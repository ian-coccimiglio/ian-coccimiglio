Hey there, you&rsquo;ve found the place where you can figure out who I am.

I&rsquo;m completing my Masters in Biomedical Engineering at the Rossi Lab at the University of British Columbia. I&rsquo;m a long-time coach, occasional marathon runner, and computational biologist.

My technical software background.

-   Worked in Windows through my undergraduate, moved to Linux and Mac in 2020. Most worthwhile technical choice I&rsquo;ve ever made.
-   I use Manjaro (btw). Still not cool enough to be with the Arch crowd.
-   I started learning vim editing in 2021, but I was compelled to try Doom EMACS in 2023. Now I believe any editor can improved with Vim key-bindings, [even CRISPR.](https://xkcd.com/1823)
-   I&rsquo;m now working in the realm of biological imaging and statistical analysis, mixed in with some machine-learning

I&rsquo;m currently working on the following scientific and software-development projects:


<a id="org25584b0"></a>

# Clonal Dynamics of Regenerating Muscle Stem Cells

[Project: Transposon-Tracking]
Leveraging Bayesian statistics to gain insight into muscle-progenitor renewal.


<a id="org11a8733"></a>

# Semi-Automated Muscle Fiber Imaging Platform

[Project: Lightning-Fiber]
A fast Fiji-based platform which addresses the vexing problem of quickly imaging, segmenting, and measuring muscle fibers. Developed with direct biologist input.

# Mapping Exercise Training To Exercise Performance

[Project: Delta-Performance]
The goal of coaching has always been to find the most effective ways to train.
